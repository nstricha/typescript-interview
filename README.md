# Front-end Interview Exercise
The following exercise will test your understanding of promises and async. The only requirement is basic knowledge of ES6 and TypeScript. The time allotted for this exercise is 1 hour.

## Getting Started
Download the source code and run `npm i` followed by `npm test`. This will install npm packages and run the Jest test runner in "watch" mode. 

## The Challenge
Your task is to make all tests pass by modifying the code in `membership.service.ts`. 

The tests are found in `membership.service.spec.ts`. Read them carefully and write the code that will satisfy them. You may use the internet and debug the code as you see fit.

#### Good luck!
